Instead of a probability mass function, continuous distributions use a probability density function (PDF).

This z-score represents the number of standard deviations the raw score is away from the mean.\n",

This eliminates the need for separate tables for every possible normal distribution.\n",
        "    - **Comparison:** It allows for the comparison of data from different normal distributions with different means and standard deviations. By converting values to z-scores, you can see how they rank relative to their respective distributions.\n",

It states that, under certain conditions, the sampling distribution of the mean of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In simpler terms, if you take many random samples from any population (regardless of whether it's normally distributed or not) and calculate the mean of each sample, the distribution of these sample means will tend to follow a normal distribution as the sample size increases. The larger the sample size, the closer the sampling distribution of the mean will be to a normal distribution.\n",
        "    - **Statistical Inference:** It is the backbone of many statistical inference techniques, particularly those involving hypothesis testing and confidence intervals. Because the sampling distribution of the mean is approximately normal for large sample sizes, we can use the properties of the normal distribution to make inferences about the population mean based on sample data.\n",
        "    - **Allows for Analysis of Non-Normal Data:** The CLT allows us to apply statistical methods that assume normality (like t-tests and z-tests) even when the original population data is not normally distributed, as long as the sample size is sufficiently large. This significantly broadens the applicability of these powerful statistical tools.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Confidence intervals** are a fundamental tool in statistical analysis used to estimate an unknown population parameter (like a population mean or proportion) based on sample data. They provide a range of plausible values for the parameter, along with a measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimate.\n",
        "    - **Quantifying Uncertainty:** Point estimates (like the sample mean) provide a single value as an estimate for the population parameter. However, they don't convey how precise or reliable that estimate is. Confidence intervals address this by providing a range, indicating the margin of error around the point estimate. A wider interval suggests more uncertainty, while a narrower interval suggests less uncertainty.\n",
        "    - **Providing a Range of Plausible Values:** Instead of saying the population mean is exactly the sample mean, a confidence interval states that we are, for example, 95% confident that the true population mean lies within a specific range. This is a more realistic and informative way to present estimates, acknowledging the variability inherent in sampling.\n",
        "    - **Facilitating Decision Making:** Confidence intervals can aid in decision-making. If a confidence interval for a parameter includes a specific value of interest (e.g., a target value or a value representing a null hypothesis), it suggests that the sample data is consistent with that value.\n",

        "1.  **Understanding the CLT:** The Central Limit Theorem states that if you take sufficiently large random samples from any population, the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the shape of the original population distribution. The mean of this sampling distribution will be equal to the population mean, and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution (called the standard error) will be the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Applying CLT to Sales Data:** In this scenario, your `daily_sales` data represents a sample of sales from the retail company's operations. Even though you only have 20 data points (which is a relatively small sample size), the CLT suggests that if you were to take many such samples of daily sales, the distribution of the average sales from each sample would tend towards a normal distribution. This allows us to use statistical methods based on the normal distribution to make inferences about the true average daily sales of the company.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Estimating the Population Mean:** Since we don't know the true average daily sales for all days the company has operated, we use the sample mean from your `daily_sales` data as our best point estimate for the population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Calculating the Confidence Interval:** A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true population mean. To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the average sales using the CLT and your sample data, you would typically follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "    *   **Calculate the sample mean:** Compute the average of your `daily_sales` data.\n",
        "    *   **Calculate the sample standard deviation:** Compute the standard deviation of your `daily_sales` data. Since the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is relatively small (n < 30), we will use the sample standard deviation and the t-distribution to calculate the confidence interval.\n",
        "    *   **Determine the critical value:** For a 95% confidence interval with a small sample size and unknown population standard deviation, you would use the t-distribution. You would find the critical t-value based on your desired confidence level (95%) and the degrees of freedom, which is your sample size minus 1 (n-1).\n",
        "    *   **Calculate the standard error:** The standard error of the mean is an estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. It's calculated by dividing the sample standard deviation by the square root of the sample size.\n",
        "    *   **Calculate the margin of error:** The margin of error is the range around the sample mean that is likely to contain the true population mean. It's calculated by multiplying the critical t-value by the standard error.\n",
        "    *   **Construct the confidence interval:** The 95% confidence interval is calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "        Confidence Interval = Sample Mean ± Margin of Error\n",
        "\n",
        "        Lower Bound = Sample Mean - Margin of Error\n",
        "        Upper Bound = Sample Mean + Margin of Error\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Interpretation:** The resulting 95% confidence interval means that if you were to take many random samples of daily sales and calculate a confidence interval for each sample, approximately 95% of those intervals would contain the true average daily sales for the company. It provides a range within which you can be 95% confident the true average sales lie, based on your sample data.\n"
